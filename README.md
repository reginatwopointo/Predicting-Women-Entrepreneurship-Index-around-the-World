# Predicting-Women-Entrepreneurship-Index-around-the-World

## Problem

### We are looking to analyze how different factors affect the Women Entrepreneurship Index. Based on that, we are trying to predict the Women Entrepreneurship Index around the World.

*Our goal is to determine what factors influence the Women Entrepreneurship Index and how it can potentially be increased overall and in countries with lower Women Entrepreneurship Index. We can evaluate these factors through a correlation matrix. We will look at feature correlation to analyze the most contributing factors to the Women Entrepreneurship Index.

*Models include: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Linear Lasso, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Regressor, Voting Regressor.

*Data set is enriched with additional features Gender Inequality Index, Ease of Doing Business, Corporate Tax Rates 2020, Schooling (Years)
